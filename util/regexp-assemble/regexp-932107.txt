# Word list for rule 932107 (RCE Unix command injection part 3/3)
#
# To convert to a regexp that can be pasted into the rule:
#   cat regexp-932107.txt | ./regexp-cmdline.py unix | ./regexp-assemble.pl
#
# Entries starting with ' are used verbatim.
# Everything after # is a comment.
#
# To prevent some FP for a command, you can require command parameters
# after a command. Only do this if the command regularly causes FP and if
# allowing the bare command (without parameters) is not too dangerous.
# (Note: due to \b following the regexp, a word boundary is also required
# further on, so some letter/number is needed for a match). Example:
#
#   diff+

ps 
vi+
pwd
