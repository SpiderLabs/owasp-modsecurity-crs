* There are still false positives for standard web applications in
  the default install (paranoia level 1). Please report these when
  you encounter them.
  False Positives from paranoia level 2 rules are less interesting,
  as we expect users to write exclusion rules for their alerts in
  the higher paranoia levels.
* Permanent blocking of clients is based on a previous user agent / IP
  combination. Changing the user agent will thus allow to bypass
  this new filter. The plan is to allow for a purely IP based
  filter in the future.
* Apache 2.4 prior to 2.4.11 is affected by a bug in parsing multi-line
  configuration directives, which causes Apache to fail during startup
  with an error such as:
    Error parsing actions: Unknown action: \\
    Action 'configtest' failed.
  This bug is known to plague RHEL 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS users.

  We advise to upgrade your Apache version. If upgrading is not possible,
  we have provided a script in the util/join-multiline-rules directory
  which converts the rules into a format that works around the bug.
  You must re-run this script whenever you change or update a CRS rule.
