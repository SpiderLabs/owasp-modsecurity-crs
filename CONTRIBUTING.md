# Contributing to the CRS

We value third-party contributions. To keep things simple for you and us,
please adhere to the following contributing guidelines.

## Getting Started

* You will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit a [ticket for your issue](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues), assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you specify the version that you know has the issue.
  * Bonus points for submitting a failing test along with the ticket.
* If you don't have push access, fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch for your feature or bug fix.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commits adhere to the rules guidelines below.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the [proper format](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html): The first line of the message should have 50 characters or less, separated by a blank line from the (optional) body. The body should be wrapped at 70 characters and paragraphs separated by blank lines. Bulleted lists are also fine.

## General Formatting Guidelines for rules contributions

 - 4 spaces per indentation level, no tabs
 - no trailing whitespace at EOL or trailing blank lines at EOF
 - comments are good, especially when they clearly explain the rule
 - try to adhere to a 80 character line length limit
 - if it is a chained rule, alignment should be like
 ```
SecRule .. ..\
       "...."
       SecRule .. ..\
           "..."
           SecRule .. ..\
               ".."
 ```
 - use quotes even if there is only one action, it improves readability (e.g use ```"chain"```, not ```chain```, or ```"ctl:requestBodyAccess=Off"``` instead of ```ctl:requestBodyAccess=Off```)
 - always use numbers for phases, instead of names
 - the proposed order for actions is:
 ```
 id
phase
disruptive-action
status
capture
t:xxx
log
nolog
auditlog
noauditlog
msg
logdata
tag
sanitiseArg
sanitiseRequestHeader
sanitiseMatched
sanitiseMatchedBytes
ctl
setenv
setvar
chain
skip
skipAfter
```
