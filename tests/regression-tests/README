Welcome to the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) Regression Tests
Regression tests for OWASP CRS are written to work with the Framework for Testing WAFs (FTW). They are stored in a separate Github repository. While these tests are available as part of the CRS project they are provided in the form of a git-submodule. Using a git-submodule allow us to update the tests without making changes to the main rule repository.

You can download the documentation using git:
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
	
Alternatively, you can manually clone the testing repository at https://github.com/SpiderLabs/OWASP-CRS-regressions
