# The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set is distributed under

# Please see the enclosed LICENCE file for full details.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------


#
# The rules in this file will cause ModSecurity to let requests for static
#   content go into the server without being examined (mostly media content). 
#   This can reduce the load on the server considerably.
#
# This ruleset will skip all tests for media files, but will skip only the
#   request body phase (phase 2) for text files. To skip the outbound stage
#   for text files, add file 47 (skip_outbound_checks) to your configuration,
#   in addition to this file
#
# NOTE  If you are using mod_rewrite to rewrite URLs, please keep in mind
#         that some URLs may seem static, when they are not. for example,
#         if you have a rule like this in your configuration:
#           RewriteRule (.*).gif images.php?id=$1 [QSA]
#         then requests to the gif files will pass through ModSecurity without
#         inspection.
#


# We skip inspection GET & HEAD requests that have no parameters
# and that end with static content file extension
