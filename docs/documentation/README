Welcome to the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) documentation.
The OWASP CRS documentation is generated as a Sphinx project and is stored in a separate Github repository. While the documentation is available as part of the CRS project it is provided in the form of a git-submodule. Using a git-submodule allow us to update the documentation without making changes to the main rule repository.

You can download the documentation using git:
	$ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
	
Alternatively, the latest version of the documentation is available at https://www.modsecurity.org/CRS/Documentation/
